### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Valentin, a trained biochemist from Germany, looking to start my new journey in the data world.

I recently graduated from an intensive full-time [Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/data-science) to firmly understand the concepts and methods and build a solid techstack:

**Python, Unix, Github, Pandas, SQL, Visualization,  
Algorithms, SVM, EDA, Machine Learning, Tensorflow, Keras,  
Scrum, Agile Methoden, Time Series**

I'm currently looking for work, while I continue to expand my Python and SQL knowledge and hone my Data Science skills in personal projects:

My recent Data Science Projects:  
[BrainWatchers - Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Computer Vision](https://github.com/tamap94/ds-capstone-alzheimers-)
