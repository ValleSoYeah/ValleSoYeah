# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Valentin, a biochemistry PhD from Germany, looking to start my new journey in the data world.

### My Data Science Training:

I recently graduated from an intensive full-time [Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/data-science#curriculum) to firmly understand the concepts and methods and build a solid techstack:

<code>Python, Unix, Github, Pandas, SQL, Visualization,</code>  
<code>Algorithms, SVM, EDA, Machine Learning, Tensorflow, Keras,</code>  
<code>Scrum, Agile Methoden, Time Series</code>

My Capstone-Project:  
[BrainWatchers - Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Computer Vision](https://github.com/tamap94/ds-capstone-alzheimers-)

### What now?

I'm currently looking for work, while I continue to expand my Python and SQL knowledge and hone my Data Science skills in personal projects
