# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Valentin, a guy from Germany with a PhD in biochemistry, currently mid-transition towards a professional role in data science.
---  

### Why the job transition?
While the experimental part of scientific research is wildly interesting, for me the real fun begins not before I can dive deep into the resulting data.  
I hugely enjoyed to look for any relations and emerging patterns in order to extract new knowledge and make insightful decisions for my future experiments.  
As a data scientist I now want to focus all my attention to this part of the process and apply both my scientific background and domain knowledge as well as my ever-growing coding skills to help potential stakeholders to get the most out of their data.

I recently graduated from an intensive full-time [Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/data-science#curriculum) to firmly understand the concepts and methods and build a solid techstack:

<code>Python, Unix, Github, Pandas, SQL, Visualization,</code>  
<code>Algorithms, SVM, EDA, Machine Learning, Tensorflow, Keras,</code>  
<code>Scrum, Agile Methoden, Time Series</code>

My Capstone-Project:  
[BrainWatchers - Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Computer Vision](https://github.com/tamap94/ds-capstone-alzheimers-)

### What now?

I'm currently looking for work, while I continue to expand my Python and SQL knowledge and hone my Data Science skills in personal projects
